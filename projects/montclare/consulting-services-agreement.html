                Each SOW will include reasonable details, at a minimum, about the Consulting Services and Fees charged in performing the Consulting Services. Consultant and Client agree to cooperate in good faith to achieve satisfactory completion of the Con-sulting Services in a timely and professional manner.

                The Parties will each designate a representative to interface and facilitate the successful completion of the Consulting Services (Client's Representative and Consultant's Representative, respectively). Any Subcontractor designated by Consul-tant to perform any portion of the Services will designate a representative to interface with Client and Consultant on all mat-ters relating to Subcontractor's performance of Services (Subcontractor's Representative).

                Consultant will perform the Consulting Services, directly or through a Subcontractor of its choice. Client agrees to pro-vide, at no cost to Consultant, timely and adequate assistance and other resources reasonably requested by Consultant to enable the performance of the Consulting Services by Consultant (collectively, Assistance).

Client may object to Consultant's election of Sub-contractors by specifying its objection to Consultant, in which case the Parties will cooperate in good faith to appoint another Subcontractor to perform such Consulting Services. Consultant may replace Personnel in its normal course of business, pro-vided that Consultant will be responsible for the performance of Consulting Services by all Personnel.

                The performance of Consulting Services may be subject to a retainer to be paid in advance by Client upon execution and delivery of the SOW. Such retainer will be applied against Fees which become payable by Client pursuant to this Agreement. Consultant may refuse to perform Consulting Services unless and until such retainer is paid to Consultant.

                Consultant will indemnify and hold Client harmless, from and against any claim against Client alleging that any Work Made For Hire (as deﬁned below) infringes or misappropriates a third party's valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an IP Claim). Consultant will, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages ﬁnally awarded against Client in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Consultant for such defense, provided that (a) Client promptly notiﬁes Consultant of the threat or notice of such IP Claim, (b) Consultant will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim, and (c) Client fully cooperates with Consultant in connection therewith. Consultant will have no liability or obligation under this Section 8 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or speciﬁcations provided by Client; (ii) modiﬁcation of the Work Made For Hire by anyone other than Consultant; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Work Made For Hire with other hardware or software where the Work Made For Hire would not by itself be infringing.

                For the purposes of this Agreement, “Conﬁdential Information” means all information disclosed by Consultant to Client or by Client to Consultant which is in tangible form and labeled conﬁdential (or with a similar legend) or which a reasonable person would understand to be conﬁdential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure. Notwith-standing the foregoing, Conﬁdential Information shall not include information that (a) was already known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) was or is obtained by the receiving party by a third party not known by the receiving party to be under an obligation of conﬁdentiality with respect to such information; (c) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by
violation of these Terms; (d) was or is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party's Conﬁdential Information; (e) constitutes Subscriber Data (as that term is deﬁned in the Subscription Terms), the use, protec-tion and disclosure of which is governed exclusively by the Subscription Terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="text-bold">9.2.</span>
                Subject to the express permissions of this Agreement, Consultant and Client will protect each other's Conﬁdential Infor-mation from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Conﬁdential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use the other Party's Conﬁdential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Conﬁdential Information solely to those of its Personnel who have a need to know such Conﬁdential Information for such purposes and who are bound to maintain the conﬁdentiality of, and not misuse, such Conﬁdential Information.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="text-bold">9.3.</span>
                Subject to the express permissions of this Agreement, Consultant and Client will protect each other's Conﬁdential Infor-mation from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Conﬁdential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use the other Party's Conﬁdential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Conﬁdential Information solely to those of its Personnel who have a need to know such Conﬁdential Information for such purposes and who are bound to maintain the conﬁdentiality of, and not misuse, such Conﬁdential Information.

                The Parties acknowledge that any unpermitted disclosure of a party's Conﬁdential Information is likely to cause the dis-closing party irreparable harm for which its remedies at law would be inadequate. Accordingly, each Party (as the receiving party) acknowledges and agrees that the Party disclosing Conﬁdential Information will be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, to the issuance of injunctive relief, without bond, enjoining any breach or threat-ened breach of the receiving party's obligations hereunder with respect to the Conﬁdential Information of the disclosing party, and such further relief as any court of competent jurisdiction may deem just and proper.

                <span class="text-bold">9.5.</span>
                Upon termination of this Agreement or a request by a disclosing party, each party, as a receiving party of Conﬁdential Information, will return to the disclosing party any and all copies of the material containing the other party's Conﬁdential Infor-mation, or any portion thereof, in the possession of the receiving party, except for information necessary to implement the objectives of this Agreement after its termination.

                Unless otherwise expressly speciﬁed in a SOW, no deliverable provided in connection with the Consulting Services provid-ed pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a “Work Made For Hire” under this Agreement. In the event that any such deliv-erable is held to be a Work Made For Hire, Client hereby assigns to Consultant all right title and interest therein or to the extent such assignment is not permitted or eﬀective, hereby grants to Consultant a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, ful-ly-paid, sublicenceable (through multiple layers), assignable license to any such deliverable. Subject to Section 10.2, Client and Consultant agree that Client shall retain all right, title and interest in any deliverable expressly stated in an SOW to be a Work Made for Hire.”

Preexisting Technology means all of Consultant's inventions (whether or not patent-able), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, concepts, information and tools in existence prior to the commence-ment of the Consulting Services. Developed Technology means ideas (whether or not patentable) know-how, technical data, techniques, concepts, information or tools, and all associated intellectual property rights thereto developed by Consultant or its Personnel in connection with providing Consulting Services pursuant to this Agreement that derive from, improve, enhance or modify Consultant's Preexisting Technology. Generic Components means all inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, information and tools, including without limitation software and programming tools developed by Consultant or its Personnel in connection with providing Consulting Services generally to support Consultant's product and/or service oﬀerings (including, without limitation the Service) and which can be so used without use of Client's Conﬁdential Information.
